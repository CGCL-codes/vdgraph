We have picked a vulnerability in CWE-119 (CVE-1016-9601) as an example,  which is patched by modifying the variable type of the variable new_heightd in line 11. According to the analysis, this function triggers a buffer overflow vulnerability on line 19 due to a possible negative value for new_height of type int on line 11, which makes the if condition on line 13 not satisfied.
Therefore, the characteristics of this vulnerability (ground truth) are as follows: the new_height variable definition in line 11 is used as the root cause of the vulnerability, and then the new_height is sliced forward until the vulnerability is triggered in line 19.

All these files are our experiment results.
